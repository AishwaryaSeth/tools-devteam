vcflib-tools
============

A collection of Galaxy wrappers for vcflib utilities. This is a development copy of the tools that exit in Galaxy main toolshed (http://usegalaxy.org/toolshed).

Because vcflib can only be reliably compiled on Linux platforms at this time these wrappers make this assumpltion.
