Historically Galaxy Tool Shed provided its own way of packaging software required for Galaxy tools.
Some of the so called 'package recipes' are available in this folder and also available for installation
at the Main Tool Shed. However Galaxy adopted the Conda package manager for such tasks and writing new
package recipes is a deprecated activity. Read more about this transition and framework in 
our [documentation](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/admin/conda_faq.html).
